https://yuryavdeev.github.io/respondents/survey/create-survey/responds    

The main functionality is available on the route - /survey/create-survey/responds:    
1. There are three conditions available that can be added to the survey form by selecting them from the drop down list,
re-adding is not allowed.    
2. Added fields can be deleted by clicking on the corresponding button on the field itself.    
3. The bottom "select" on the condition field is to display the selected option before it is added to the form.  
4. Clicking the  "Протестировать опрос" (Test) button displays a message that the form is complete.    
5. Clicking the "Отправить" (Submit) button submits the form data and then clears it.
6. All "submit" buttons (green) become available after data validation.
